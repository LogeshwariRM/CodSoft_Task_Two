    <h2>About Paris</h2>
    <div class="about">
      <div>
        <p>Paris, the capital of France, is renowned for its art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.
             The city boasts iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum, attracting millions of visitors every year. 
             Paris is also famous for its charming streets, cafés, and rich history dating back over 2,000 years.</p>
            Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by three international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport, and Beauvais–Tillé Airport.
            Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice. 
            Paris is known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet, and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art.
            The Pompidou Centre, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art.
            Part of the city along the Seine has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.
            The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period.
            The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated.
            According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario- ('cauldron').
            Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as kwar-is-io-. 
            Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier *kwar-sā.
            Residents of the city are known in English as Parisians and in French as Parisiens. They are also pejoratively called Parigots.
            Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine, whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of Paris.
            The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from Paris. Paris is spread widely on both banks of the river.
            Overall, Paris is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. 
            Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).
